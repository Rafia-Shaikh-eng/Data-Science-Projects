<h2>Project#01: Exploratory data analysis on dataset Who suicides</h2>
<h3>Project Description</h3>
<p>I obtained a dataset called "WHO Suicide Statistics" from the Kaggle website, which covers basic historical data from 1979 to 2016. I first processed the data by evaluating and filling in missing values with the mean, and ensuring the correct data format. I then performed exploratory data analysis using the Seaborn library in Python, which is a data visualization tool based on matplotlib. The results of the analysis showed that a higher proportion of suicides were committed by males, with a lower proportion committed by females. Additionally, the results indicated that the suicide rate has decreased over the years</p>
